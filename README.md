1. Implement 3 unfinshed functions

2. Deal with this part:
    "Displays available options in a table format for the selected category, 
    including details such as the item name, price, brand (if applicable), 
    description, and return policy."

    - Is brand just the name? or do we actually need a new field for this
    - (Added) Return policy can be a manually updated field (not in constructor)
      with default at 30 days or something
    - Should we generate a description using the atributes we already have
      or do we need a new field
